# DbTestAwk

## What the heck does this do?
It is a domain specific language created in AWK that allows testing
that migrations are done properly on a sqlite3 database.

## Why use AWK?
Because AWK is awesome. Even the name AWK is great.
I also followed the amazing book "The AWK programming langauge"
which shows how to make domain specific languages in AWK.

## How does it work
See the tests for examples.
